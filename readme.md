ShinyLoot Link Maker
====================

This program uses ShinyLoot's API to create links you can use to download all the files for games you've purchased
on ShinyLoot.

To use, simply build, and run the program. It will prompt you for your username and password, and then write links
to a file. `links.txt` contains the download links, and `with_keys.txt` contains the name of games with keys and
which keys they contain.

If you don't want comments in the links file, give the program the "/n" argument.
